        I develop multi-page websites, corporate sites, landing pages,
        portfolios, blogs, and online stores — always with performance,
        accessibility, and SEO in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        For each project, I pick the perfect tech stack—custom code from scratch
        or no/low-code platforms like Webflow, Webstudio, Shopify or Framer,
        depending on your goals.

        Is your site loading slowly, not ranking well, underperforming, or
        looking outdated? I'll pinpoint what's holding it back and make it work
        harder for your business.From complete redesigns to precise technical
        improvements, I make websites faster, more engaging, and easier to grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Performance optimization, SEO improvements, design updates, engaging
        animations, better user experience, and accessibility improvements —
        everything your site needs to reach its full potential.

      <p>Design isn't my specialty, though I designed this site myself.</p>
      <p>
        That's why I partner with skilled and reliable designers who create
        visuals that make you stand out from the crowd and boost your
        conversions. Together, we create websites that don't just look good —
        they work hard to grow your business.

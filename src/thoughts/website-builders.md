In website development, choosing clean code is the most effective way to ensure lightning-fast load speeds, SEO, accessibility, and scalability. However, businesses often choose website builders for various reasons. After 5+ years in development, I've worked with many of them: Webflow, Framer, Wix, Squarespace, Tilda, and others.

I categorize these tools into three levels of complexity. The boundaries are often blurry and depend on project requirements, platform updates, and third-party integrations.

## 1. The owner builds the site themselves

**Wix, Squarespace, Tilda, etc.**

These platforms have a low entry barrier, many templates, and ready drag-and-drop blocks. Launch is fast and inexpensive. This works if you don't need a unique design, have a small number of pages, and no serious SEO requirements.

## 2. The owner hires a designer

**Webflow, Framer, Webstudio, WordPress editors like Elementor, etc.**

In this case, the designer acts as a visual developer. They have more freedom with layout and animations, which leads to a more distinctive design. This can improve conversion and help the brand stand out.

## 3. The owner hires both a designer and a developer

**Advanced Webflow usage, Webstudio + headless CMS, WordPress editors like Oxygen, etc.**

This approach allows for more complex integrations. Loading speed, code quality, SEO, and scalability can be close to custom development.

## Speed vs. Quality

Choosing a tool is almost always a trade-off. For example, a Wix site can be launched in one day but might take 4–6 seconds to load. A Webflow site may take weeks to build but loads in 1–2 seconds, which directly impacts SEO and conversions.

## My recommendation

If you're choosing a website builder for business, take a look at **Webstudio** — it's often overlooked compared to more popular platforms. What stands out:

- **Performance** — high loading speed
- **SEO and semantics** — full control over settings, proper HTML tags instead of only divs
- **Accessibility** — ability to add any attributes to improve a11y
- **Flexibility** — connection to any headless CMS
- **Freedom** — free plan and self-hosting option (both for the site and the builder)
